# no_black_box_ML
Don't know if it is a good idea but I think I'll start with ML without using any library (or if it is too difficult to do that I think might be tensorflow only, spare me)

1. Types and foundations of machine learning algorithms: It is important to understand the different types of machine learning algorithms and their foundations. This will help you choose the right algorithm for your task and understand how it works [1].

2. Machine learning basics: There are several basic concepts and techniques involved in machine learning that you should be familiar with. These include supervised and unsupervised learning, regression, classification, clustering, and neural networks, among others [3].

3. Machine learning courses: Following a structured program or course is one of the best ways to learn machine learning from scratch. There are hundreds of in-person and online courses available, and you can choose to take an ML/AI course at any stage of your learning process [2].
